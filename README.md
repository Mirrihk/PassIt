# SlapPass
SlapPass is a Universal Windows App designed to generate pseudo-random passwords.

## About
"SlapPass" Stands for "Slap a Password on it".  Something which every Tech Professional will tell you we should be doing for all of our technology and accounts.  SlapPass makes the process of generating more secure passwords suited to any user's needs easier.  Simply press a button, and it's done.  You can even copy the password straight to your clipboard in-app.
SlapPass even allows you to omit non-alphanumeric characters (such as punctuation) or ambiguous characters (such as 1, I, and l).

## Installation
1. Download the 'master' branch of the GitHub repository, and open the Visual Studio Solution (.sln) file in your version of Microsoft Visual Studio (Tested in Microsoft Visual Sudio 2017).
2. Run "Build Solution" from the Build menu.
3. It's done!

I am working on getting this app available in the Windows Store, for Desktop, and Windows Phone users to make install easier, and will update when it's done.
